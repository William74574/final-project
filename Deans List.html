            <p> This was when I recieved the Deans list award. As you may know, the deans list is a a list of students recognized for academic achievement during a semester by the dean of the college they attend. I was overwhelmed with joy when I recieved this award. It was not an easy task. Through hard work and dedication I put myself out there and managed to impress my university.</p>
